### Chess Overview
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8×8 grid of alternating light and dark squares.  
- Each player controls 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.  
- One side is White, the other is Black. White always makes the first move.  
- Players alternate moves, making exactly one move per turn.

### Board Overview
Board consist of 8×8 grid = 64 squares.
Rows of that grid counted from 1 to 8 from bottom to top.
Each row has 8 columns `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`.
Every figure on the board has determined position described be 2 symbols, `[column][row]`. e.g. King `e1` which means that figure King is located on the 1th row, on the `e` position(5th one).
Every move from one position to another, in UCI format, is described by 2-positions(source and target) or 4 symbols. e.g. Pawn `e2e4` means that figure pawn moved from position `e2` to `e4`.

### Objectives
The primary objective is to checkmate the opponent’s king — to place it under attack (“check”) with no legal move to escape.  
Secondary objectives include gaining material advantage, controlling important squares (especially the center), and improving the activity and safety of pieces.  

### Legal Moves
A move is legal only if:  
1. The move follows the movement rules of the chosen piece.  
2. The destination square is either empty or occupied by an opponent’s piece (which is then captured).  
3. After the move, the player’s own king is **not** left in check.  
   - This means moves that expose your king to check are illegal.  

### Piece Movement
- **Pawn**: Moves forward 1 square; from its initial position, it may move 2 squares forward. Captures 1 square diagonally forward.  
  - Special: *En Passant* (see below).  
  - Special: *Promotion* upon reaching the farthest rank.  
- **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.  
- **Knight**: Moves in an “L” shape (2 squares in one direction, then 1 perpendicular). It can jump over pieces.  
- **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.  
- **Queen**: Combines rook and bishop movement.  
- **King**: Moves 1 square in any direction. Special move: *Castling* (see below).

### Piece priority
**King** is the most prioritized piece to defend. It you lose it then game is over, your lost. Always defend it as much as possible.
**Queen** is the second most priority piece after **King**. The most strong piece and only one for each color.
**Pawn** has the lowest priority. The most weak piece on the board. 8 pawns available for each color at game start.
**Rook**, **Knight**, **Bishop** have the same priority between **Queen** and **Pawn**. You have 2 of each type at start game start.

### Special Rules
- **Castling**: The king and one rook move simultaneously.  
  - Conditions:  
    1. Neither the king nor the chosen rook has previously moved.  
    2. All squares between king and rook are empty.  
    3. The king is not in check.  
    4. The king does not pass through a square under attack.  
    5. The king does not end in check.  
- **En Passant**: If a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and passes next to an enemy pawn, that enemy pawn may capture it as if it had moved only one square.  
- **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opponent’s back rank, it must be promoted to one of: queen, rook, bishop, or knight (chosen by the player).  
- **Check**: When a king is under attack, the player must make a move that removes the check.  
- **Checkmate**: If the king is in check and there is no legal move to remove it, the game is over.  
- **Draws**:  
  - Stalemate (no legal moves but not in check).  
  - Threefold repetition (same position appears 3 times with the same player to move).  
  - Fifty-move rule (50 consecutive moves without a pawn move or capture).  
  - Insufficient material (e.g., king vs king; king vs king + bishop; king vs king + knight).
